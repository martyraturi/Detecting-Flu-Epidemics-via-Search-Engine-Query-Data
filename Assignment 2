#When handling a skewed dependent variable, it is often useful to predict the logarithm of the dependent variable instead of the dependent variable itself -- this prevents the small number of unusually large or small observations from having an undue influence on the sum of squared errors of predictive models. In this problem, we will predict the natural log of the ILI variable, which can be computed in R using the log() function.
#Plot the natural logarithm of ILI versus Queries. What does the plot suggest?.


plot(log(FluTrain$ILI),FluTrain$Queries)



#Let's call the regression model from the previous problem (Problem 2.1) FluTrend1 and run it in R. Hint: to take the logarithm of a variable Var in a regression equation, you simply use log(Var) when specifying the formula to the lm() function.
#What is the training set R-squared value for FluTrend1 model (the "Multiple R-squared")?

#Problem 2.3 - Linear Regression Model
#For a single variable linear regression model, there is a direct relationship between the R-squared and the correlation between the independent and the dependent variables. What is the relationship we infer from our problem? (Don't forget that you can use the cor function to compute the correlation between two variables.)
cor(FluTrain$Queries, log(FluTrain$ILI))

#The csv file FluTest.csv provides the 2012 weekly data of the ILI-related search queries and the observed weekly percentage of ILI-related physician visits. Load this data into a data frame called FluTest.
#Normally, we would obtain test-set predictions from the model FluTrend1 using the code
#PredTest1 = predict(FluTrend1, newdata=FluTest)
#However, the dependent variable in our model is log(ILI), so PredTest1 would contain predictions of the log(ILI) value. We are instead interested in obtaining predictions of the ILI value. We can convert from predictions of log(ILI) to predictions of ILI via exponentiation, or the exp() function. The new code, which predicts the ILI value, is

FluTest <- read.csv(file.choose())
PredTest1 = exp(predict(FluTrend1, newdata=FluTest))


#What is our estimate for the percentage of ILI-related physician visits for the week of March 11, 2012? (HINT: You can either just output FluTest$Week to find which element corresponds to March 11, 2012, or you can use the "which" function in R. To learn more about the which function, type ?which in your R console.)

#Problem 4.1 - Training a Time Series Model
#The observations in this dataset are consecutive weekly measurements of the dependent and independent variables. This sort of dataset is called a "time series." Often, statistical models can be improved by predicting the current value of the dependent variable using the value of the dependent variable from earlier weeks. In our models, this means we will predict the ILI variable in the current week using values of the ILI variable from previous weeks.
#First, we need to decide the amount of time to lag the observations. Because the ILI variable is reported with a 1- or 2-week lag, a decision maker cannot rely on the previous week's ILI value to predict the current week's value. Instead, the decision maker will only have data available from 2 or more weeks ago. We will build a variable called ILILag2 that contains the ILI value from 2 weeks before the current observation.
#To do so, we will use the "zoo" package, which provides a number of helpful methods for time series models. While many functions are built into R, you need to add new packages to use some functions. New packages can be installed and loaded easily in R, and we will do this many times in this class. Run the following two commands to install and load the zoo package. In the first command, you will be prompted to select a CRAN mirror to use for your download. Select a mirror near you geographically.

install.packages("zoo")
library(zoo)

#After installing and loading the zoo package, run the following commands to create the ILILag2 variable in the training set:
ILILag2 = lag(zoo(FluTrain$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE)
ILILag2
FluTrain$ILILag2 = coredata(ILILag2)
ILILag2

#In these commands, the value of -2 passed to lag means to return 2 observations before the current one; a positive value would have returned future observations. The parameter na.pad=TRUE means to add missing values for the first two weeks of our dataset, where we can't compute the data from 2 weeks earlier.
#How many values are missing in the new ILILag2 variable?
summary(FluTrain$ILILag2)


#Use the plot() function to plot the log of ILILag2 against the log of ILI. Which best describes the relationship between these two variables?
plot(log(FluTrain$ILILag2), log(FluTrain$ILI))

#Problem 4.3 - Training a Time Series Model
#Train a linear regression model on the FluTrain dataset to predict the log of the ILI variable using the Queries variable as well as the log of the ILILag2 variable. Call this model FluTrend2.
#Which coefficients are significant at the p=0.05 level in this regression model? (Select all that apply.)
#What is the R^2 value of the FluTrend2 model?

FluTrend2 = lm(log(ILI) ~ Queries + log(ILILag2), data = FluTrain)

summary(FluTrend1)

#Problem 5.1 - Evaluating the Time Series Model in the Test Set
#So far, we have only added the ILILag2 variable to the FluTrain data frame. To make predictions with our FluTrend2 model, we will also need to add ILILag2 to the FluTest data frame (note that adding variables before splitting into a training and testing set can prevent this duplication of effort).
#Modify the code from the previous subproblem to add an ILILag2 variable to the FluTest data frame. How many missing values are there in this new variable?

ILILag2 = lag(zoo(FluTest$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE)
